# üß™ Proteomics Analysis Pipeline

This repository provides a streamlined workflow for analyzing proteomics data using mzML files and [Sage](https://github.com/lazear/sage).

---

## üì¶ Environment Setup

### 1. Create Conda Environment

Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create the analysis environment:

```bash
conda env create -f envs/environment.yml
conda activate mzml_env
```
## üîÅ Workflow
The pipeline consists of the following steps:

### 1. Convert RAW to mzML
Run the script to convert individual .raw files to .mzML format:

```bash
bash convert_raws.sh
```
### 2. Merge mzML files per sample
Use the merge_mzmls.sh script to combine individual mzML files into one per sample:
```bash
bash merge_mzmls.sh
```
### 3. Run Sage
Execute Sage using the prepared JSON configuration:

‚ö†Ô∏è CPU usage spikes significantly during this step, so please monitor your system accordingly.

```bash
sage global_250715.json
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Step (for now)
Before running Sage, manually update the following section in global_250715.json:

```bash
"mzml_paths": [
  "/absolute/path/to/sample1/merged.mzML",
  "/absolute/path/to/sample2/merged.mzML"
]
```
üõ† This step will be automated in a future update.

## üìÅ Output Files

| File               | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `results.sage.tsv` | **Main identification result** from Sage. Contains peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) with scores, q-values, and protein assignments.    |
| `tmt.tsv`          | **TMT quantification table**, with intensities for each peptide across TMT channels. Includes modification, uniqueness, and q-values. |
| `raw_list.txt`     | List of original `.raw` files used as input for conversion to mzML.                                                                   |
| `sample_dirs.txt`  | List of sample directories that were processed and merged during the merging step.                                                    |
